##RE: {{ Property.DisplayAddress }}
A landlord has invited you to apply for their property to rent. Please complete the application form by clicking the following link: [Complete Application]({{ AppUrl }}).


Completing the application form takes 2 minutes and allows for us to verify your name and address to protect both your, and the landlord’s security. Any reputable letting agent would ask for the same information. Once our basic security checks have been done, your details will be passed to the landlord who will decide whether to invite you to be referenced. To view the property on Rightmove, please click the following link;
